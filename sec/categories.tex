\subsection{Standard globe}

\anibal{In the Steenrod section you have a piecewise linear map from the cube, which is appealing because of the rigidity of such maps. Maybe the statement is that it factors through the/a projection from the cube to the standard globe?}

\begin{theorem}
	\label{thm:map-from-the-globe}
	If a framed polytope $(P,\{v_k\})$ has the bot-top property, then there is an equivariant cellular map $\mathbb{G}^\infty \to P$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
	We suppose that $P$ has dimension $n\geq 0$.
	In the iterated monotone path polytope associated to $\{v_k\}$, each $P_k$ is defined via the linear functional $\angles{-,v_k}$.
	We consider the iterated monotone path polytope associated to the linear functionals
	\begin{equation} \label{eq:new-projection}
		\frac{\angles{-,v_k}-\angles{\bm_{v_k}(P_{k-1}),v_k}}{\angles{\tp_{v_k}(P_{k-1})-\bm_{v_k}(P_{k-1}),v_k}}
	\end{equation}
	where each $P_{k-1}$ is sent to the interval $I$, the vertex $\bm_{v_k}(P_{k-1})$ is sent to $0$ and $\tp_{v_k}(P_{k-1})$ is sent to $1$.
	We construct inductively a family of continuous piece-wise linear cellular maps
	\[
	\triangle_k, \triangle_k^{\op}: I^k \to P \ , 0 \leq k \leq n-1
	\]
	such that the two maps $\triangle_k$ and $\triangle_k^{\op}$ are both homotopies between $\triangle_{k-1}$ and $\triangle_{k-1}^{\op}$.
	We can also extend the construction to a $\triangle_n : I^n \to P$ which will be an homotopy between $\triangle_{n-1}$ and $\triangle_{n-1}^{\op}$.

	First, we define $\triangle_0 (*) \defeq \bm_{v_1}(P)$ and $\triangle_0^{\op} (*) \defeq \tp_{v_1}(P)$.
	Then, the vertices $\bm_{v_2}(P_1)$ and $\tp_{v_2}(P_1)$ define uniquely sections $\triangle_1, \triangle_1^\op : I \to P$ such that $\triangle_1(0)=\triangle_1^\op(0)=\bm_{v_1}(P)$ and $\triangle_1(1)=\triangle_1^\op(1)=\tp_{v_1}(P)$.
	These sections are coherent monotone paths on $P$, defined explicitly by
	\begin{align*}
		\triangle_1(x) & = \bm_{v_2}(\pi_1^{-1}(x)) \\
		\triangle_1^\op(x) & = \tp_{v_2}(\pi_1^{-1}(x))
	\end{align*}
	for $x \in I$, where $\pi_1 : P \to I$ denotes the projection with respect to the linear functional (\ref{eq:new-projection}) in the case $k=2$.
	Next, the vertices $\bm_{v_3}(P_2)$ and $\tp_{v_3}(P_2)$ define monotone paths on $P_1$ between $\bm_{v_2}(P_1)$ and $\tp_{v_2}(P_1)$.
	We consider the associated (tight coherent) subdivisions of $I$, induced by $\pi_2 : P_1 \to I$.
	We denote the vertices of these subdivisions by
	\begin{align*}
		x_1 & =\pi_2(\bm_{v_2}(P_1)), x_2, \ldots, x_{p-1}, x_p=\pi_2(\tp_{v_2}(P_1)) \\
		y_1 & = \pi_2(\bm_{v_2}(P_1)), y_2, \ldots, y_{q-1}, y_q=\pi_2(\tp_{v_2}(P_1)) \ .
	\end{align*}
	All these vertices are projections of vertices of $P_1$, which in turn have associated tight coherent sections $\triangle_{x_i}: I \to P$.
	We define a map
	\[
	\triangle_2 : I \times I \to P \ ,
	\]
	where the first copy of $I$ receives the subdivision by the $x_i$, $1\leq i \leq p$, via the formula
	\[
	\triangle_2(x_i, z) \defeq \triangle_{x_i}(z) \ ,
	\]
	and on each of the cubes $[x_i,x_{i+1}]\times I$ by the formula
	\[
	\triangle_2(t,z) \defeq \left( \frac{x_{i+1}-t}{x_{i+1}-x_i} \right) \triangle_{x_i}(z) + \left( \frac{t-x_i}{x_{i+1}-x_i} \right) \triangle_{x_{i+1}}(z) \ .
	\]
	We proceed in a similar fashion to define $\triangle_2^\op$ with the $y_j$.
	Continuing in the same fashion, we define inductively the next maps
	\[
	\triangle_k, \triangle_k^\op : I \times I^{k-1} \to P \ , 3 \leq k \leq n-1 \ .
	\]
	For the last step, we observe that $P_{n-1}$ is a segment, so we can simply define
	\begin{eqnarray*}
		\triangle_n : I \times I^{n-1} & \to & P \\
		(t,z) & \mapsto & (1-t)\triangle_{n-1}(z) + t \triangle_{n-1}^\op (z) \ .
	\end{eqnarray*}
	These maps that we obtain are by construction continuous, cellular, equivariant under the action of $\Sym_2$ permuting $\triangle_k$ and $\triangle_k^\op$ (or sending $v_k$ to $-v_k$), and even piece-wise linear.
	Finally, we obtain a map from $\mathbb{G}^\infty$ by defining all the higher maps trivially mapping to the point $P_n$ and taking the colimit.
\end{proof}
