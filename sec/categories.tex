\begin{definition}
	Local bot-top property ...
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
	Admissible...
\end{definition}

\begin{lemma}
	Local bot-top is equivalent to admissible.
\end{lemma}

\begin{definition}
	Let $P \subset \R^n$ be a polytope.
	A KV system is \emph{$P$-admissible} if and only if every $k$-dimensional face of $P$ is sent injectively to $\R^k$, for all $1\leq k \leq n$.
\end{definition}

\begin{proposition}
	\label{prop:P-admissible}
	A KV system is $P$-admissible if and only if for any $k$-dimensional face $F_k$ of $P$, the vector $v_k$ is not perpendicular to the line $\LinSpan(F_k) \cap \ker \pi_{k-1}$.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
	Requiring $\pi_1$ to be injective on the 1-faces of $P$ is exactly asking that for every 1-face $F_1$, we have $\LinSpan(F_1)\cap \ker \pi_0=0$, which is the same as requiring that $v_1$ is not perpendicular to $\LinSpan(F_1)$.
	Note that on both sides, it is not possible that the condition for $k=2$ is satisfied while the condition for $k=1$ does not hold.
	So, supposing that this last condition holds, we have indeed that for all 2-face $F_2$ of $P$, $\LinSpan(F_2)\cap \ker \pi_1$ is a line (the dimension of $\LinSpan(F_2)\cap \ker \pi_1$ is at least 1, and if it was 2 it would mean that some 1-faces of $F_2$ are perpendicular to $v_1$).
	Requiring that $\pi_1$ is injective on 2-faces of $P$ is exactly asking that for every 2-face $F_2$ of $P$, we have $\LinSpan(F_2)\cap \ker \pi_2=0$, which is the same as requiring that $v_2$ is not perpendicular to $\LinSpan(F_2)\cap \ker \pi_1$.
	Continuing in the same fashion, we get the equivalence between the injectivity condition on both sides.
\end{proof}


\begin{proposition}
	\label{prop:KV-BS}
	A KV system is $P$-admissible if and only if in the associated BS system, $v_k$ orients $P_{k-1}$, for all $1\leq k \leq n$.
\end{proposition}

In order to prove this, we first prove the following general lemma.

\begin{lemma} \label{lemma:orients-the-fibers}
	Let $P \xra{\pi} Q$ be a projection of polytopes.
	A vector $v$ orients the fiber polytope $\Sigma_\pi(P,Q)$ if and only if it orients every fiber $\pi^{-1}(q), q \in Q$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
	The normal fan of $\Sigma_\pi(P,Q)$ is the common refinement of the normal fans of the fibers $\pi^{-1}(q), q \in Q$ \cite[Proposition 2.2]{BilleraSturmfels94}.
	It follows that the set of directions of the edges of $\Sigma_\pi(P,Q)$ is the union of the sets of directions of the edges of $\pi^{-1}(q), q \in Q$.
	Indeed, the edge directions of $\Sigma_\pi(P,Q)$ are normal directions to the walls of $\mathcal{N}_{\Sigma_\pi(P,Q)}$, which are precisely covered by the union of the walls of $\mathcal{N}_{\pi^{-1}(q)}, q \in Q$.
\end{proof}

\begin{proof}[Proof of \cref{prop:KV-BS}]
	From the preceding lemma, we get that the lines generated by the edges of $P_{k-1}$ are exactly the lines $\LinSpan(F_k)\cap \ker \pi_{k-1}$, for $F_k$ a $k$-face of $P$.
	By \cref{prop:P-admissible}, $P$-admissibility is equivalent to requiring that $v_k$ is not perpendicular to these lines, which is then (by definition) requiring that $v_k$ orients~$P_{k-1}$.
\end{proof}

We observe that if $v$ orients $P$, then every face $F$ of $P$ has a unique vertex $\bm_v(F)$ (resp. $\tp_v(F)$) which minimizes (resp. maximizes) the scalar product $\angles{-,v}$.


\anibal{split the second part of this:}

\begin{proposition}
	Let $\{v_k\}$ be an orthogonal basis of $\R^n$, and let $P\subset \R^n$ be a full-dimensional polytope.
	Then, we have that
	\[
	(D_P,\{v_k\}) \text{ has the bot-top property (resp. } \{v_k\} \text{ is }D_P\text{-admissible)}
	\]
	\[
	\iff (P\cap \rho_z P,\{v_k\}) \text{ has the bot-top property (resp. } \{v_k\} \text{ is }P\cap \rho_z P\text{-admissible)} \ \forall z \in P \ .
	\]
	Moreover, in both cases, we have that $\{v_k\}$ is $P$-admissible.
\end{proposition}
